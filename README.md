# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ☕ GolestanCo-Clone-with_reactjs

A **React** front-end project by Ramtin Neshatvar, built to meticulously clone the user interface and experience of the official Golestan Tea Company website. This project served as a deep technical exercise in advanced component architecture, localization (RTL), and seamless responsiveness.

The goal was to move beyond basic cloning and implement production-level front-end challenges.

## ✨ Technical Highlights

| Feature | Implementation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Component Architecture** | React Functional Components | Structured the entire site into reusable React components (`Products`, `Majale`, `Counter`, etc.). |
| **RTL Layout Mastery** | Full Localization | Implemented a pixel-perfect **Right-to-Left (RTL)** design flow using CSS, essential for Persian content. |
| **Styling Strategy** | CSS Modules | Employed **`.module.css`** for component-scoped styling to prevent global conflicts. |
| **Mobile Navigation** | Dynamic Dropdown Menu | Engineered a custom mobile menu with a smooth **dropdown effect** and a dynamically transforming hamburger icon. |
| **Interactive Design** | Brand-Color Transitions | Social media icons transition from **Gray** to their **specific brand colors** on hover/click. |
