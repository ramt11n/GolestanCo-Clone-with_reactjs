# ‚òï GolestanCo-Clone-with_reactjs

A **React** front-end project by Ramtin Neshatvar, built to meticulously clone the user interface and experience of the official Golestan Tea Company website. This project served as a deep technical exercise in advanced component architecture, localization (RTL), and seamless responsiveness.

The goal was to move beyond basic cloning and implement production-level front-end challenges.

## ‚ú® Technical Highlights

| Feature | Implementation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Component Architecture** | React Functional Components | Structured the entire site into reusable React components (`Products`, `Majale`, `Counter`, etc.). |
| **RTL Layout Mastery** | Full Localization | Implemented a pixel-perfect **Right-to-Left (RTL)** design flow using CSS, essential for Persian content. |
| **Styling Strategy** | CSS Modules | Employed **`.module.css`** for component-scoped styling to prevent global conflicts. |
| **Mobile Navigation** | Dynamic Dropdown Menu | Engineered a custom mobile menu with a smooth **dropdown effect** and a dynamically transforming hamburger icon. |
| **Interactive Design** | Brand-Color Transitions | Social media icons transition from **Gray** to their **specific brand colors** on hover/click. |
